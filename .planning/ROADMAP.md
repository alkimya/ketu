# Roadmap: Ketu

## Milestones

- ✅ **v1.0 Production Stability** — Phases 1-7 (shipped 2026-02-12, archived to `.planning/milestones/v1.0-ROADMAP.md`)
- ✅ **v1.1 Flexibility & Houses** — Phases 8-12 (shipped 2026-05-08, archived to `.planning/milestones/v1.1-ROADMAP.md`)
- ✅ **v1.2 Astrologie relationnelle et prédictive** — Phases 13-20 (shipped 2026-05-28; `ketu==1.2.0` on PyPI, archived to `.planning/milestones/v1.2-ROADMAP.md`)
- ✅ **v1.3 Chiron & Engine Hardening** — Phases 21-27 (+ inserted 26.1) (shipped 2026-06-01; `ketu==1.3.0` on PyPI — Chiron embedded as 14th body, engine hardened to 100% coverage, data-driven aspect engine, full French docs; archived to `.planning/milestones/v1.3-ROADMAP.md`)
- ✅ **v1.4 Dynamic Harmonics & Chiron Range** — Phases 28-32 (shipped 2026-06-03; `ketu==1.4.0` on PyPI via OIDC — on-the-fly `generate_harmonic_aspects(h)` generator wired through the full detection chain with the frozen `core.aspects` table + preset fingerprints byte-identical, Chiron orb 0°→4° (Pluto parity), Chiron range widened to 1900–2100 (`.npz` regenerated, max|Δλ|=0.001214°), docs recentred on the 180°-division default (en+fr); archived to `.planning/milestones/v1.4-ROADMAP.md`)
- ✅ **v1.5 Lunar Declination & Harmonics Debt** — Phases 33-35 (shipped 2026-06-04; `ketu==1.5.0` on PyPI via OIDC — additive minor: equatorial declination δ as a first-class vectorizable quantity (`declination` / `declination_velocity` / `is_ascending_declination` / `is_out_of_bounds` + `body_decl` in `CHART_DTYPE`), dynamic-harmonics debt paydown (ASP-F2 `H{h}-{k}` naming contract, ASP-F3 `find_aspect_timing` `dyn_coef` orb derivation, ASP-F1 CLI `--harmonics h7`). No breaking changes; `is_ascending` (β) and the frozen `core.aspects` table stay byte-identical. Archived to `.planning/milestones/v1.5-ROADMAP.md`.)
