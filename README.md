# ketu

Little library to compute positions of astronomical bodies (Sun, Moon, planets
and mean Node aka Rahu), generate time series and calendars based on planetary 
aspects.

Need python 3.9+, pyswisseph: `pip install pyswisseph` and numpy: `pip install 
numpy`

At the moment, compute bodies positions and aspects for a date, interactively.

Move to ketu directory, run `python ketu.py` and answer the questions.

 * find all aspects between two dates
